# Script to Plant interactions shift the relationship of richness to mean range-size relationship
This repository includes the script for "Plant interactions shift the relationship of richness to mean range size from positive to negative at the Glacialâ€“Holocene transition". 
All the scripts for data analysis, as well as for the generation of figures and tables are shown here. The main files included are as follows:
0_resampling
1_calculation: Based on the resampling result, this script calculates plant richness, mean range-size, and heterogeneity. The output includes the results and Supplementary Figure 1.
2_cushion_tree: Cushion plant taxa and tree plant taxa abundance change over time based on the resampling result.
3_merge_plot: Based on the resampling, plant richness to mean range-size relationship was calculated with the 5,000-year running time window, the richness, mean range-size, heterogeneity,
              and the temperature result and the isotope result of NGRIP ice core were all shown in the 5,000-year running time window. The output in this step include Figure3, Figure4,
              Supplementary Figure2, Supplementary Figure4, and Supplementary Figure7.
4_binomial_regression: In this step, we did the binomial regression, response variables of 
richness to range-size relationship (R>0.2 for positive and R<-0.2 for negative), 
 cushion plant abundance, and tree plant abundance as the explanatory variables
